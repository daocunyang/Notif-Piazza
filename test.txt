Got stop words in result
For the top words I got, I have stop words like &#34;-&#34; and &#34;.&#34; in my result. I put the stopword file in the same directory as config file,which should be correct. Is there anything I did wrong or I should just put it on result or I should remove it?
TA please confirm that stop words like &#34;-&#34; can appear in the final result.
Can TA confirm this?
number of iterations newgg
Can someone share the number of iterations expected for the newegg dataset?
---------
Log likelihood is probably better than the # of iterations.
about 300 when 5 topics for mine
was it around 140 iterations (LL -7e7) for 3 topics? 
where do the documents come from?
when I try to run the lda model for question 2.2

I get

========== doc_id 0 topic distribution ==========[ 0.00098425  0.00098425  0.719488    0.00098425  0.276575    0.00098425]========== doc_id 1 topic distribution ==========[  1.06013000e-01   1.10759000e-02   2.80063000e-01   5.27426000e-04   6.01793000e-01   5.27426000e-04]========== doc_id 2 topic distribution ==========[ 0.0164577  0.659091   0.0007837  0.306426   0.0164577  0.0007837]========== doc_id 3 topic distribution ==========[  5.86166000e-04   4.74795000e-02   6.33646000e-01   2.98945000e-02   2.98945000e-02   2.58499000e-01]========== doc_id 4 topic distribution ==========[ 0.00058962  0.00058962  0.554835    0.0241745   0.419222    0.00058962]

I understand that the topic of doc_id 1 is highly related to the topic group 2.
But I am not sure where the documents come from and how they get divided.
Is there a way to check the contents of the document?
All the data you have is in the abstract/ or egg/ or..  folder. They are in specific format, you can google about how to open .dat file.
Formatting question MP4
Do we have to exactly match the submission_example.txt for the file that we have to submit?

Can there be an empty line between two different topics?

Or do we have to put everything all sticked together?
There should not be an empty line, you can simply copy the example file given to us and replace it.
